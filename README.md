# MERN-full-stack Project Mini Dictionary App

- Frontend : React JS,Bootstrap,FontAwesome Icons

- Backend : NODE JS ,Express JS

- Database : MongoDB

- API : Oxford Dictionary API to get dictionary data

- After making this mini project ,I got good confidence and learnt more things ..

## Features

- Add Any search term to get meaning ,origin ,examples of that word (I used free #OXFORD_API ,so only few words are available)

- Added Data will be stored in #MONGODB database

- The users can able to add a new word on the app, which would be asynchronously fetched on the backend using the appropriate Oxford REST API.

- User can to add, view the added words and search for them.

- Words List and Search built on top of the data cached in MongoDB and should never interact with the Oxford APIs directly

- Used google Kumbh Sans font
